# udacity_dand_p2_openstreetmap
dand 2nd project openstreetmap

## Project Overview
I have chosen St. Louis area in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. Finally, I have chosen SQL as the data schema to complete this project.

## Steps
1. Downloaded 419 MB OpenStreetMap data from openstreetmap.org in XML OSM format
2. Used python script to reshape the dataset and clean the dataset, then convert them into csv format to import to MySQL 
3. Query and audit the dataset and looking for insights from data
